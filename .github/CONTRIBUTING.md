# Contribute WP ERP

The only way an open-source project truly moves forward is through community involvement and contribution. PRs, issues, localisations and any other contributes are extremely welcome and always encouraged!

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request for a customization don't post here.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).**
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the WP ERP repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by the WP ERP developers (me).
* Please don't modify the changelog or .pot file/s - this will be maintained by WP ERP developers.

At this point you're waiting on us to merge your pull request. We'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.

**Don't be scared**. Any contribution at all is appreciated and important. I'll be more than happy to give you feedback and work with you to ensure you're able to contribute. :)
